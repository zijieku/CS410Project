If we can help more people do more stuff in a digital way online, its good for the internet and good for us, he said.Key background: Big banks have been facing competition from technology upstarts, especially those geared toward Millennials and mobile-first consumers. These include money transfer services like Venmo, which is rolling out a own debit card. To carve out its own space in payment services, Google Pay will have to compete with similar apps from the likes of Apple, Samsung and Facebookwhich earlier this week released a Facebook Pay service to use across its apps.Tangent: According to a recent survey by consulting firm McKinsey & Co. cited in the Wall Street Journal report, 58% of consumers would trust financial products from Googlethat scored better than Facebook (35%) and Apple (56%) but worse than Amazon (65%).Further reading: Dawn Of The Neobank: The Fintechs Trying To Kill The Corner Bank (Jeff Kauflin) Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
