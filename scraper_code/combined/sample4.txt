I had a chance topreviewthe AI-powered video chatting device when it launchedSeptember 18 and where it competes bestis in its ability to have fun. If Facebook can continue to provide a steady cadence of playful, engaging content drops, Portal TV has a good shot at growing its installed base. Volume of new content is key.Additionally, with more premium streaming options coming into the market in 2020 like HBO Max, the hope is that Facebook will soon addNetflix, Disney+, Apple TV+ and Hulu, and turn on the Watch Together feature for its content partners.Perhaps the biggest potential for Portal TV lies in becoming a developers platform, particularly with its AI stack. Its still early days for the device but with F8 just a few months away, stay tuned.
