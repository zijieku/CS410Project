Overall, 11 out of the 20 Safest Dividend Yield stocks outperformed the S&P 500 & Russell 2000 from October 23, 2019 through November 19, 2019.Only my firms research utilizes the superior data and earnings adjustments featured by the HBS & MIT Sloan paper,"Core Earnings: New Data and Evidence. This Model Portfolio leverages my firmsRobo-Analyst technology[1], which scales my forensic accounting expertise (featured in Barrons) across thousands of stocks.[2]This Model Portfolio only includes stocks that earn anattractive or very attractiverating, have positive free cash flow andeconomic earnings, and offer a dividend yield greater than 3%. Companies with strongfree cash flowprovide higher quality and safer dividend yields because I know they have the cash to support the dividend. I think this portfolio provides a uniquely well-screened group of stocks that can help clients outperform.Featured Stock for November: Verizon CommunicationsVerizon Communications (VZ), is the featured stock in Novembers Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio. I made VZ a Long Idea inSeptember 2019and the stock remains undervalued.In 2018, VZ grew revenue by 4% year-over-year and after-tax operating profit (NOPAT) by 22% YoY, per Figure 1. Trailing twelve month (TTM) NOPAT is up 12% over the prior TTM period. Longer-term, VZ has grown NOPAT by 4% compounded annually over the past decade. Profit growth is driven by VZs NOPAT margin rising from 15% in 2008 to 18% TTM.Figure 1: VZs Revenue & NOPAT Growth Since 2017VZ Rising ProfitsNew Constructs, LLCVZs Free Cash Flow Supports Dividend PaymentsVerizon has increased its annual dividend payment in each of the last 12 years. Since 2014, VZ has increased its annual dividend from $2.16/share to $2.42/share TTM, or 2% compounded annually. This dividend payment has been supported by VZs cumulativefree cash flow. VZs free cash flow decline came to an end in 2018, after the firm promoted former CTO Hans Vestburg to CEO and halted its value-destroying acquisition strategy. Since then, FCF has improved significantly, per Figure 2. From 2014-2018, VZ generated $50.7 billion (21% of market cap) in FCF while paying $44.8 billion in dividends.Figure 2: VZs FCF vs. Dividends Since 2014VZ FCF vs. DividendsNew Constructs, LLCCompanies with strong free cash flow provide higher quality dividend yields because I know the firm has the cash to support its dividend. On the flip side, dividends from companies with low or negative free cash flow cannot be trusted as much because the company may not be able to sustain paying dividends.VZ Remains UndervaluedAt its current price of $59/share, VZ has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.6. This ratio means the market expects VZs NOPAT to permanently decline by 40%. This expectation seems too pessimistic given that VZ grew NOPAT by 22% YoY in 2018, 11% YoY in the TTM period, and 9% compounded annually over the past two decades.If VZ can maintain TTM NOPAT margins (18%) and grow NOPAT by just 2% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth $110/share today an 86% upside.See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario.Critical Details Found in Financial Filings by My FirmsRobo-Analyst TechnologyAs investors focus more on fundamental research, research automation technology is needed to analyze all the critical financial details in financial filings as shown in the Harvard Business School and MIT Sloan paper,"Core Earnings: New Data and Evidence.Below are specifics on the adjustments I make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Verizon Communications 2018 10-K:Income Statement: I made $21.6 billion of adjustments with a net effect of removing $7.1 billion innon-operating expense(5% of revenue).
